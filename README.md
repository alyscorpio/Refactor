# <Refractor>

## Description
For this project, I edited existing code for the marketing agency Horiseon. My goal was to refractor the code so that it implemented semantic HTML elements, and met accessibility standards. The refractoring process required replacing <div> elements with semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <section>, and <article>. Once this was done, I modified the attached CSS document so that the website appeared and functioned the same as it did before refractoring. In order to meet accessibility standards, I added alt attributes to the images with concise descriptions. 

While completing this project, I learned about the purpose of refractoring, semantic HTML elements, web accessibility, and CSS.
